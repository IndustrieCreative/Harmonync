Download Pd-extended [here](https://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended), and install it.\r\n  2. Download the last version of Harmonync patch from this page by clicking \"Download ZIP File\" or the original first public version [here](http://harmonync.org/harmonync-firstpublic.zip), then unzip the files in the archive.\r\n  3. Run the harmonync_gui.pd file.\r\n\r\nNote: Do not rename or move any other file inside the main folder. Move all files and folders together.\r\n  \r\n## How to use it?\r\nThere is no guide at this moment, it is currently being drafted. There will be a video-guide as soon as possible.\r\nFor any questions you may ask at armonici.it[*at*]gmail[*dot*]com.\r\n\r\n## First public document\r\nThe document \"**A first look at THE HARMONYNC: A Dynamic Harmonics Calculator – Draft of Specifications and User Guide**\" is available [here](http://blog.armonici.it/harmonync/a_first_look_at_the_harmonync.pdf) and have the following DOI: [10.978.88940077/01](http://dx.doi.org/10.978.88940077/01)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
