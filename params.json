{"name":"Harmonync","tagline":"a Dynamic Harmonics Calculator","body":"![Harmonync](http://harmonync.org/harmonync_logo.png \"Harmonync - a Dynamic Harmonics Calculator\")\r\n\r\n## What is this?\r\nThe Harmonync is a platform that allow the user/musician to play the tones of the Harmonic Series and changing its fundamental tone in real-time.\r\nJust like the overtone singers do with the [polyphonic overtone singing technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haz6W7p8xjM).\r\nThe idea is to play a fundamental-variable harmonic series on electronic and electro-acoustical instruments retuned via MIDI and in real-time.\r\nThe name come from the union of the words “Harmonic” and “Sync”.\r\n\r\nActually the Harmonync is prototyped as a patch for Pure Data using the Extended Libraries.\r\nThe first release was developed with Pd-extended 0.43.4 for Mac OS X but it should run on other platforms.\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n  1. Download Pd-extended [here](https://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended), and install it.\r\n  2. Download the last version of Harmonync patch from this page by clicking \"Download ZIP File\" or the original first public version [here](http://harmonync.org/harmonync-firstpublic.zip), then unzip the files in the archive.\r\n  3. Run the harmonync_gui.pd file.\r\n\r\nNote: Do not rename or move any other file inside the main folder. Move all files and folders together.\r\n  \r\n## How to use it?\r\nThere is no guide at this moment, it is currently being drafted. There will be a video-guide as soon as possible.\r\nFor any questions you may ask at armonici.it[*at*]gmail[*dot*]com.\r\n\r\n## First public document\r\nThe document \"**A first look at THE HARMONYNC: A Dynamic Harmonics Calculator – Draft of Specifications and User Guide**\" is available [here](http://blog.armonici.it/harmonync/a_first_look_at_the_harmonync.pdf) and have the following DOI: [10.978.88940077/01](http://dx.doi.org/10.978.88940077/01)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nHarmonync – a Dynamic Harmonics Calculator\r\nCopyright (C), 2014-Today Walter Mantovani\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as\r\npublished by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the\r\nLicense, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
