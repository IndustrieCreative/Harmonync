# Harmonync
a Dynamic Harmonics Calculator

## What is this?
The Harmonync is a platform that allow the user/musician to play the tones of the Harmonic Series and changing its fundamental tone in real-time.
Just like the overtone singers do with the [polyphonic overtone singing technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haz6W7p8xjM).
The idea is to play a fundamental-variable harmonic series on electronic and electro-acoustical instruments retuned via MIDI and in real-time.
The name come from the union of the words “Harmonic” and “Sync”.

Actually the Harmonync is prototyped as a patch for Pure Data using the Extended Libraries.
The first release was developed with Pd-extended 0.43.4 for Mac OS X but it should run on other platforms.

## Quick Start
  1. Download Pd-extended [here](https://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended), and install it.
  2. Download the Harmonync patch from the [project page](http://industriecreative.github.io/Harmonync/) on GitHub and unzip the files in the archive.
  3. Run the harmonync_gui.pd file.
  
## How to use it?
There is no guide at this moment, it is currently being drafted. There will be a video-guide as soon as possible.
